# Data Lakehouse SQL Agent

Welcome to the **AI-powered SQL Agent** for your Data Lakehouse!

## What can I do?

Ask questions about your data in **plain English** - I'll translate them to SQL queries and get you answers.

## Available Data

Your Gold layer contains analytics-ready tables:
- **Customer Analytics**: lifetime value, segmentation, purchases
- **Sales Data**: enriched transactions with customer and vehicle details
- **Charging Network**: station utilization and energy consumption
- **Vehicle Fleet**: health analysis and usage patterns

## Example Questions

Try asking:
- "Show me the top 10 customers by total spent"
- "Which cities have the most charging sessions?"
- "What vehicles need maintenance?"
- "Average transaction value by payment method"

## How it works

1. You ask a question in natural language
2. I analyze your question and write a SQL query
3. I execute it against Dremio (your query engine)
4. I return the results with an explanation
